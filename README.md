# Simple Desktop Git Client

When I was working with my GF an another non programming partners we found
difficult the use of GIT. Is great when you are working in a coding project
with other coders, where using it is the staple of the industry, but not so
good and friendly with other people or when you are working in non development
projects that still benefit from GIT.

The INITIAL idea of the software is to create some Desktop software that is
easy to install, doesn't require any kind of accounts for the moment, and that
allows you to easily interact with git.

**TODO**:
- [ ] Be able to interact with the git folder in a GUI environment.
- [ ] Show git logs in a new window.
- [ ] Show git diff in a new window.
